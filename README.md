# Agent-Based Modeling for Archaeology
Welcome to the code repository for *Agent-Based Modeling for Archaeology*, by Iza Romanowska, Colin D. Wren, and Stefani A. Crabtree. In the folders above, you will find the NetLogo code referenced in each chapter, along with the following additional files where applicable: .CSV, ASCII, Excel, Python, R, images, and more. 

Within the colorblind_friendly folder you'll find additional versions of many models with the color schemes adjusted to be the more colorblind friendly. These are the versions we used to make the figures in the digital color version of the book. Check the book's appendix for a detailed explanation of how to code colorblind friendly models.

This book uses the modeling software NetLogo. If you do not have NetLogo v6 already, you can get it here:
