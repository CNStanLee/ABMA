## Chapter 1: The Foundational Steps of Building an Agent-based Model 
Models and additional files for chapter 1 of Agent-based Modeling for Archaeology by Romanowska, Wren, & Crabtree. 

You will need to download the map file (ch1_map.png) to complete the chapter. Make sure it is in the same folder as your model. You will write the Y&B model yourself as you work through the chapter but can use our version to check your work.
