Models and additional files for chapter 1 of Agent-based Modeling for Archaeology by Romanowska, Wren, & Crabtree. 

You will write the Y&B model yourself as you work through the chapter but can use this version to compare with yours if you would like to check your work. Download the map file and place it in the same folder as your model.
