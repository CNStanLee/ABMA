## Chapter 2: Trading up to Complex Models of Economic Interaction
Models and additional files for chapter 2 of *Agent-based Modeling for Archaeology* by Romanowska, Wren, & Crabtree. 

You will write the model yourself as you work through the chapter but can use our version to check your work. 

Note that on GitHub the usual method of right-clicking a file and choosing "Save Link As..." will not work (you'll get a github webpage version of the file which won't work in NetLogo). Instead left-click on the file you want, then locate the `RAW` button in the top-right. Right-click that and "Save Link As..." to download the files correctly. Alternatively, install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and *clone* the whole repository (~100mb).
