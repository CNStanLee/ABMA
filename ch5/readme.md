## Chapter 5: Exchange Algorithms: How Do People Trade in Goods, Ideas, and Pathogens?
Models and additional files for chapter 5 of *Agent-based Modeling for Archaeology* by Romanowska, Wren, & Crabtree. 

In this algorithms chapter, we often don't give you all of the code to make the algorithms into fully functional models. If you run into problems, use the models here to figure out where you went wrong. Note that several of the cultural transmission algorithms are grouped together into the ch5_cultrans.nlogo file. 

Note that on GitHub the usual method of right-clicking a file and choosing "Save Link As..." will not work (you'll get a github webpage version of the file which won't work in NetLogo). Instead left-click on the file you want, then locate the `RAW` button in the top-right. Right-click that and "Save Link As..." to download the files correctly. Alternatively, install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and *clone* the whole repository (~100mb).
